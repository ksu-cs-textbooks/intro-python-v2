Python allows us to perform multiple actions on a single line of code, provided they can all be combined in some way to create a single statement.
Let’s consider the example on the previous page, shown here:
text_one = input("Enter the first number: ") one = int(text_one) text_two = input("Enter the second number: ") two = int(text_two) one = one * one two = two * two total = one + two print(f"The sum of squares of {one} and {two} is {total}") There are many ways we can write this program to perform the same work.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-python/03-strings-input/05-complex-statements/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
