These problems are not graded - they are just for you to practice before doing the real exercises in the lab itself. You can find the answers below each question by clicking the button below each question.
4.5 Reading Code Consider the following Python program:
a = int(input("Enter a whole number: ")) b = int(input("Enter a whole number: ")) if (a + b) % 3 == 0: print("Branch 1") else: print("Branch 2") a = a * 2 b = b * 3 if (a + b) % 3 == 0: print("Branch 3") else: print("Branch 4")What output is printed when the user inputs the values $ 2 $ and $ 4 $?</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-python/04-conditionals/09-conditionals-practice/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
