If we think about that, however, that implies that we probably should be able to place conditional statements inside of the True branch as well, or really anywhere. As it turns out, that’s exactly correct. We call this nesting, and it is really quite similar to what we’ve already seen in this lab.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-python/04-conditionals/12-nesting/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
