4.11 Reading Code Consider the following Python program:
p1 = int(input("Enter a positive integer for player 1: ")) p2 = int(input("Enter a positive integer for player 2: ")) p3 = int(input("Enter a positive integer for player 3: ")) if p1 &lt;= 0 or p2 &lt;= 0 or p3 &lt;= 0: print("Error") else: twos = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2 threes = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 3 fours = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 4 if p1 == p2 or p2 == p3 or p3 == p1: print("Tie") elif p1 !</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-python/04-conditionals/15-nesting-practice/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
