A program that doesn’t contain any conditional statements will have a linear control flow. Each time we run the program, it will execute the same steps in the same order, but it may use different data based on input from the user.
When a program contains a conditional statement, its control flow can split into different branches.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-python/05-loops/01-intro/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
