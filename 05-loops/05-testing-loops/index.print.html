So, let&rsquo;s look at some of the methods we can use when testing our programs containing loops to make sure they work correctly and won&rsquo;t run into any problems.</p><h2 id=branch-and-path-coverage>Branch and Path Coverage</h2><p>Loops, like conditional statements, introduce different branches and paths into our programs. So, one of the first steps when testing these programs is to develop a set of inputs that will execute each branch of the code, as well as finding inputs that will execute multiple different paths through the program. Since loops may repeat many times, typically we only worry about two possible paths when dealing with loops - one path where it is skipped entirely and another path where the loop is entered at least once.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s consider this simple Python program that contains loops:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=n>x</span> <span class=o>=</span> <span class=nb>int</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=nb>input</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=s2>&#34;Enter a number: &#34;</span><span class=p>))</span>

</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nb>print</span><span class=p>()</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This program will simply print a right triangle of asterisks <code>*</code> that is <code>x + y</code> characters wide and tall, similar to a previous example in this lab. However, it will also print a final line of equals signs <code>=</code> below that, consisting of <code>x - y</code> characters. To test this program, we want to try and find some input values for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> that achieve branch and path coverage.</p><h3 id=branch-coverage>Branch Coverage</h3><p>To achieve branch coverage, we want to execute each line of code in this program at least once. An easy way to do that is to provide inputs so that the sum of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is a positive number in order to enter the first loop. After the first loop terminates, the value of <code>i</code> will be equal to the sum of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, provided that value is greater than
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>. So, in order to also enter the second loop, we need to make sure the difference of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is smaller than their sum.</p><p>A set of inputs that achieves this would be
<span class="math align-center">$ 3 $</span> and
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, respectively. Their sum is
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>, so the first loop will be executed 4 times. Then, the difference between the values is
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span>, so the second loop will executed twice to reduce the value in <code>i</code> to
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span>.</p><p>So, we can say that the inputs <code>3</code> and <code>1</code> are enough to achieve branch coverage.</p><h3 id=path-coverage>Path Coverage</h3><p>To achieve path coverage, we must consider three additional paths through the program:</p><ol><li>Neither loop is entered</li><li>Only the first loop is entered</li><li>Only the second loop is entered</li></ol><p>First, in order to enter neither loop, we must have a set of inputs where the sum is less than or equal to
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, and also where the difference is less than or equal to
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>. The simplest way to achieve this is to set both inputs to exactly
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>! Sometimes the simplest inputs are the easiest for testing.</p><p>To enter the first loop only, we need the situation where the sum of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is greater than <code>0</code>, but then their difference is even larger. An easy way to accomplish this is to set <code>y</code> to a small negative number. For example, we could set <code>x</code> to
<span class="math align-center">$ 3 $</span> and <code>y</code> to
<span class="math align-center">$ -1 $</span>. That will make their sum
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span> but the difference
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>, so we&rsquo;ll only execute the first loop but not the second one.</p><p>Finally, if we want to execute the second loop only, we need to make both the sum and the difference of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> a number less than
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>. In that case, we can simply set both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to negative values, but make sure that <code>x</code> is overall a smaller value than <code>y</code>. So, we could set <code>x</code> to
<span class="math align-center">$ -3 $</span> and <code>y</code> to
<span class="math align-center">$ -1 $</span>. In that case, their sum is
<span class="math align-center">$ -4 $</span> but their difference is
<span class="math align-center">$ -2 $</span>. That will cause the program to skip the first loop but enter the second loop.</p><p>So, we can achieve path coverage with these four sets of inputs:</p><ul><li><code>3, 1</code></li><li><code>0, 0</code></li><li><code>3, -1</code></li><li><code>-3, -1</code></li></ul><h2 id=loop-termination>Loop Termination</h2><p>When testing loops, we should also check to make sure that the loops will eventually terminate if we ever enter them. Thankfully, in this program, it is very easy to reason about this and convince ourselves that it works.</p><p>Consider the first loop - the only way to enter that loop is if the value of <code>i</code> is less than the sum of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and each time the loop iterates the value in <code>i</code> will be incremented by
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>. Since <code>i</code> is getting larger each time, eventually it will reach a value that is greater than or equal to <code>x + y</code> and the loop will terminate.</p><p>The same argument can be made for the second loop. In that loop, <code>i</code> is initially greater than the difference of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, but <code>i</code> is decremented each time, so eventually the loop will terminate.</p><p>Technically speaking, we can come up with a <strong>loop variant</strong> for each loop and show that it is monotonically decreasing. This is easily done by simply finding the difference between the iterator variable <code>i</code> and the termination condition of the loop, either the sum or the difference of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. We won&rsquo;t ask you to get to this level of detail when testing your own loops, but it is a very useful concept to understand when working with loops.</p><p>There we go! We were able to quickly come up with a set of inputs that will execute all possible branches and paths in this program, and we can also show that each of the loops will properly terminate anytime they are executed. So, we know that our program at least won&rsquo;t crash, no matter what integers are provided as input. We can also examine the output of each test and make sure that it matches what the expected output should be in order to show that our program not only doesn&rsquo;t crash, but that it provides the <em>correct</em> output.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><section><h1 class=a11y-only>Subsections of Testing Loops</h1></section></div></main><div class=git-footer><p class=theme-version-footer>6.0.0</p><p>Last modified by:
