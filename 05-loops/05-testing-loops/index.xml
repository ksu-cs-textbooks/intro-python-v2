So, let’s look at some of the methods we can use when testing our programs containing loops to make sure they work correctly and won’t run into any problems.
Branch and Path Coverage Loops, like conditional statements, introduce different branches and paths into our programs. So, one of the first steps when testing these programs is to develop a set of inputs that will execute each branch of the code, as well as finding inputs that will execute multiple different paths through the program.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-python-v2/05-loops/05-testing-loops/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
