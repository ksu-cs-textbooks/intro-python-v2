As we continue to develop larger and more complex programs, it is helpful to observe the entire process from start to finish so we can see how to easily develop a program one step at a time. Once we’ve created our program, we’ll also perform a bit of testing to make sure that it works correctly.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-python-v2/05-loops/06-example/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
