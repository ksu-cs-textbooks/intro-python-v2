In fact, nesting for loops is often much simpler than nesting while loops, since it is very easy to predict exactly how many times a for loop will iterate, and also because it is generally easier to determine if a for loop will properly terminate instead of a while loop.
A great way to explore using nested for loops is by printing ASCII Art shapes.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-python-v2/05-loops/09-nested-for/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
