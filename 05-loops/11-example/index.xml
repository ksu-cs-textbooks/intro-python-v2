Consider the following problem statement:
Write a program to print the sum of the first n prime numbers, where n is provided as input from the user.
This is a very simple problem statement, but it can be very complex to build a program that satisfies it.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-python/05-loops/11-example/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
