These problems are not graded - they are just for you to practice before doing the real exercises in the lab itself. You can find the answers below each question by clicking the button below each question.
5.7 Reading Code Consider the following Python program:
x = int(input("Enter a positive integer: ")) while x &lt;= 0: print("Invalid input!") x = int(input("Enter a positive integer: ")) n = x for i in range(n - 1): for j in range(n - i - 1): print(" ", end="") for j in range(i + 1): print("* ", end="") print("") for i in range(n): for j in range(n): print("* ", end="") print("")Describe the shape that will be printed when this program is executed.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-python-v2/05-loops/12-nesting-practice/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
