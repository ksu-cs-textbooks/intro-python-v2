Let’s look at a quick example of a full Python program that includes a function that returns a value:
def square_sum(one, two): one = one * one two = two * two total = one + two return total def main(): text_one = input("Enter the first number: ") one = int(text_one) text_two = input("Enter the second number: ") two = int(text_two) total = square_sum(one, two) print(f"The sum of squares of {one} and {two} is {total}") main() To truly understand how this program works, let’s use Python Tutor to explore it step by step.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-python/06-functions/05-return/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
