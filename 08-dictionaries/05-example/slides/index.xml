Assume that there are no special squares present. The program should prompt the user to input a string that only contains letters, and then compute the total score of that string by summing the value assigned to each letter. If the user inputs a string that contains invalid characters, the program should prompt for additional input until a valid word is received.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-python/08-dictionaries/05-example/slides/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
