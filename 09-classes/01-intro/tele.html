The real world, however, isn&rsquo;t made up of lists and dictionaries, but <strong>objects</strong> that may have several <strong>attributes</strong> that describe the object, as well as several <strong>functions</strong> that the object can perform or that can be performed using the object. So, it would be very useful for us to have a way to represent those concepts directly in our programs.</p><p>For example, what if we want to have a computer program that represents a person? A person can be described by attributes such as their name, age, occupation, and more. Likewise, a person can perform many actions, such as opening a door or changing jobs.</p><p>To do this, there is a programming paradigm known as <strong>object-oriented programming</strong> which allows us to represent objects with attributes and the functions it can perform. These objects are created from a blueprint called a <strong>class</strong> and then stored in memory, just like a list or a dictionary.</p><p>In this lab, we&rsquo;ll briefly introduce the concepts of classes, objects, and object-oriented programming. We won&rsquo;t give too much detail here since this is an introductory course and Python doesn&rsquo;t require the use of objects, but if you continue on to future programming courses, you&rsquo;ll most likely use a language such as Java or C# that is very focused on object-oriented programming. Let&rsquo;s get started!</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div></div><script src=/intro-python-v2/js/clipboard.min.js?1738184480 defer></script><script src=/intro-python-v2/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1738184480 defer></script><script src=/intro-python-v2/js/theme.js?1738184480 defer></script><script src=/intro-python-v2/js/tele-scroll.js?1738184480 defer></script></body></html>
