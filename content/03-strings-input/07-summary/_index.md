## Python input

* `input(expression)` will display the `expression` to the user as a prompt, then return what was typed by the user as a string value.
* `input(expression)` is terminated by the user pressing ENTER, so next output starts on a new line.

## Python String Operators

* `+` Concatenation (join strings together). May only be applied to two strings.
* `*` Repeat (duplicate strings)
* `\` Escape Operator for special characters
* f-string are used to format output. Template strings include curly braces as placeholders `{}` and inside the placeholder is any variable or expression to be printed in that location in the template string. 

## Complex Statements

Expressions can be combined in many ways within a statement. Expressions can be used as arguments to functions, and more!
