### Course Description

This course serves as a primary introduction to modern programming by exploring core concepts such as variables, conditionals, iteration, and functions. To accomplish this goal, we will do several hands-on learning activities. While doing so, we will try to relate the concepts we are learning to real-world problems and ideas. Students will gain a solid foundation in Python, setting the stage for further study and professional use.


### Course Objectives
By the end of this course, each student will be able to:

- Understand the basics of computer programming and the significance of Python in the tech world.
- Set up a Python development environment.
- Write, debug, and execute Python programs.
- Utilize Python's built-in functions, libraries, and modules.
- Understand and apply the basic structures of programming, including variables, data types, operators, control structures, loops, and functions.
- Engage with basic object-oriented programming concepts like classes and objects.
- Create basic real-world applications using Python.

### Major Course Topics

- Programming Basics
- Variables, Numbers, and Math Operations
- Strings
- User Input and Output
- Conditional Statements
- Iteration (Loops)
- Functions
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Classes and Objects

## Course Structure

This course is structured as a lab/studio.  Lectures will vary in length depending on the topic but will typically be short in order to focus on in-class labs. As such, there will be an expectation that students come to labs prepared, having watched and read all required material ahead of time. In addition to labs, there will be projects throughout the semester to help practice and go deeper into the Python language. There will be a few quizzes/exams to verify comprehension of material learned in lab.

**CIS 116 is a studio-type course**, meaning that much of the course is done online. <u>It is expected that you complete the online material/readings **before** you come to class</u> so we can have discussions on that week's material. Class time will be dedicated to programming work. While most work for the course is available online, there will be some content that will be available **only** in class, such as labs.

<hr/>

### How to Get Help in this Course
CIS 116 might be your first programming course, so most of the material will be brand new. Therefore, you are encouraged to seek help whenever you feel you are being overwhelmed or don’t understand a topic. **You are not alone!** Most students in CIS 116 have never studied anything relating to computer programming before, so it is new to everyone. The professors and TAs are ***always*** willing to help students with ***any*** questions you may have about the class or other issues related to Computing Science. So please, don’t be afraid to ask questions. Get help early and often!     

Here are the 5 **recommended ways to get help** on CIS 116:  

- Review the course materials posted on K-State Canvas and the course website 
- Check the [Edstem Discussion board](https://google.com) to see if a similar question has been asked, otherwise, post a new question.
- Visit your professor's office hours, or the office hours for your TA if available  
- Send a message to the CIS 116 Help email ([cis116-help@KSUemailProd.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:cis116-help@KSUemailProd.onmicrosoft.com?subject=CIS%20116%20Help)).
- Ask your teammates for help or advice on assignments or projects (be mindful of the honor code!)
- Schedule a one-on-one meeting with your professor/TA  

#### More on the [Edstem Discussion board](https://google.com)

This semester, we will be using edstem.org, specifically, there Ed Discussion platform. Ed Discussion is a reddit/forum style web app that allows students to post and ask questions. This will be our preferred way of communication when it comes to questions/etc. in the course. Please adhere to the following guidelines:
- Before creating a new thread, please make sure there isn't a similar one already made.
- If you are asking a question in Ed Discussion, please correctly mark it as such along with the correct tags.
- Please make your thread public when possible in case others have the same questions.
  - Threads can be made *anonymous* when needed. Course staff may anonymize private threads and make them public if they find it to be beneficial for the class.
- When posting code, please do not post solutions or part of solutions to homework. If you need to share your code with us, please make your thread private.
- If you would like a new category or tag made, please let us know!

If you need help getting started with the platform, please go through the following links:

#### Attendance and Participation in Class Activities

**Attendance in class is required**. The majority of class periods will include hands-on programming activities to be completed in class that will help understand the topic of the day. Collaborating and communicating with others in the class is a large part of these activities and is encouraged. Participating in each of these activities is key to learning, so failing to attend class or complete in-class activities and labs will result in a reduced grade for that day’s work. ***Simply attending class does not guarantee that you will receive points\***

**Face coverings** are not required; however, they are encouraged if you are feeling ill. (See general face coverings policy down below)

**Need to miss a class?** Work will never be completely excused, however some exceptions/extensions can be given in 2 situations:

- You are absent due to a **university activity** and have given the instructor **prior notice** of the absence. Excuses after the absence will not be accepted, even for university activities

- You have a "major life event" that prevents you from completing class, such as an illness or family emergency. **These events must be verified through the K-State Office of Student Life**. Contact them **AS SOON AS YOU CAN** once you know you will be away from class. They will work with your instructors while you are gone. Contact your instructor once you are able to discuss make-up work and absences.

{{% notice note%}}
Attendance accommodations include all COVID related causes, but Student Life should still be some of the first people you contact.

### Assignments

{{% notice warning%}}
Assignments are to be completed without any collaboration with classmates or other outside help unless otherwise stated. It is crucial that all work you do is your own.  Posting (even if you don’t get a response) course content on Stack Overflow, Chegg, or other similar websites is expressly forbidden and will result in an XF. This also includes viewing solutions to course content that has not been provided to you through canvas by your instructor or TA. The use of AI assisted tools to write your assignments is also explicitly forbidden (ChatGPT, GitHub Code Pilot, etc.). You may use these tools as help in the learning process, but work that you submit for a grade must be 100% done by you and only you.

    *If you are struggling in the course or you have doubts on something, please ask!  Your instructors and TAs are here to help!*
{{% /notice %}}

There will be some programming that must be completed outside of class. It is acceptable to communicate with other students about the concepts in the assignment if you do not understand it, but you should not discuss the details of how the assignment should be completed. Your submission should be your own work, or the work of your small group if allowed by the instructor.  Some work will require you to look up certain programming syntax and techniques on the internet, **but** there is a fine line between learning and copying! ***When in doubt, ask!***

#### Grading
- 25% - Programming Labs (*Lowest lab is dropped*)
- 20% - Programming Homework 
- 10% - Quizzes (*Lowest two Quiz scores are dropped*)
- 25% - Midterm exam
- 25% - Final exam

Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale: 

90% - 100% - A; 80% - 89.99% - B; 70% - 79.99% - C; 60% - 69.99% - D; 00% - 59.99% - F 

#### Late Work

{{% notice warning%}}

Poor planning/procrastination on your part does not constitute as an emergency on ours.

{{% /notice %}}

Every student should strive to turn in work on time. *Late work will receive penalty of 10% of the possible points for each partial day it is late*. This will be pro-rated by hour. **Some assignments will NOT be accepted late**! Others will be limited to a maximum of three days late (*not always 3 days*). You can see if an assignment is accepted late by seeing if the last available date for that assignment in canvas goes past its due date. Missed class attendance cannot be made up, though as mentioned above some areas will drop the lowest score. If you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor before it becomes too late to recover.

#### Programming Work

{{% notice warning%}}
Programming assignments that are turned in and do not run or that are not in the required format will receive a grade of 0, **no exceptions**. If they only partially run, they will be graded up to the point of it crashing. My recommendation to avoid making this mistake is to check your solution after you submitted it to Canvas. **Redownload** what you submitted from Canvas and run it again to assure that the program you submitted is working as intended.
{{% /notice %}}

There will be two primary types of programming assignments: homework and labs. <u>Labs</u> will be **only** available to be completed **during designated class times** unless otherwise stated. To get credit for completing a lab, you must have your work checked off by the professor or TA before leaving class. Partial credit is awarded for labs started in class, but not completed in time. No credit is given for a lab if you do not attend class unless a prior arrangement is made given a valid reason (see attendance policy). <u>Homework</u> will be individual work unless otherwise stated and is intended to be done outside of class time. Any work that is not your own will be considered a violation of the honor code.  Class time may be used for working on homework if you have completed the lab work for that class period.
