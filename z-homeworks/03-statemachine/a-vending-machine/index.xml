This is a great way to practice both loops and conditional statements in our code.
Learning Objectives The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate understanding of the following topics in Python:
Boolean Logic Conditional Statements Loops Nested Loops &amp; Conditional Statements Loops for Input Finite State Machine in Code A finite state machine is a simple representation of a real-world system that has a defined set of states and transitions between those states.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-python/z-homeworks/03-statemachine/a-vending-machine/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
